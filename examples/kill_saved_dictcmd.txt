 | of law. Slay is a less commonplace word with the same meaning as kill. Murder
 | is the general word for killing wrongfully, especially with premeditation.
 | Assassinate means to kill wrongfully by surprise, suddenly, or by secret
 | assault. To slaughter is to kill brutally or in great numbers; massacre is
 | more intense than slaughter, meaning to kill indiscriminately, without need
 | or without warrant, rapidly or in great numbers. To despatch is to kill with
 | promptness or quickness, and generally in a quiet way. Kill, slay, slaughter,
